Movie Recommendation Engine by Python and ReactJS

Deployed app - https://netflix-clone-cd47e.web.app/

Recommender System is a system that is used to predict or filter preferences according to the choices of user. These systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, dates, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. 

# Recommender systems works on two methods – 
One is Collaborative filtering which generally build a model from the past behaviour of the user (i.e. items scrolled by the user) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model on the basis of this is used to show the items to the users they may have interested in.

Another is Content-based filtering which uses a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties. Content-based filtering methods are totally based on a description of the item and a profile of the user’s preferences. It recommends items based on the user’s past preferences.

# In my project I am using Collaborative filtering technique for predicting.

It gives result on the basis of cosine similarities.

In the CSV file, we have following attributes -
Rank,Title,Genre,Description,Director,Actors,Year,Runtime (Minutes),Rating,Votes,Revenue (Millions),Metascore

And on the basis of Director, Actors,and Genre we will be recommending movies to users.

Thank you for visiting :)
